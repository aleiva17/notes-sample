## Description

Welcome to the Easy Notes Frontend Repository! Here, you'll find the frontend codebase for our intuitive note-taking web application. Seamlessly integrated with our Notes API, this frontend empowers users to effortlessly manage their notes and tags in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Deploy in Netlify:
https://easy-notes-sample.netlify.app/

> [!NOTE] 
> It will still require the backend, running in localhost:3000.


## Features:
- **Modern UI:** Enjoy a sleek and intuitive user interface designed to enhance your note-taking experience with **dark** and **light** theme.
- **Integration with Notes API:** Leveraging our Notes API, this frontend enables seamless communication with the backend for efficient CRUD operations on notes and tags.
- **Tagging Functionality:** Organize your notes efficiently by associating them with multiple tags, allowing for easy categorization and retrieval.

## Requirements for runtimes, engines, tools, etc
- **Node v20.11.1**: This project was built using this version of node. However, it may still be compatible with some minor versions.
- **NPM v10.5.0**: Node Package Manager for node dependencies
- **Vite v5.2**: Frontend tooling for bundling 
- **React JS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.3**: A utility-first CSS framework
- **React Router DOM v6.23**: React router for handling routes 
- **Headless UI v1.7.19**: Completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components, designed to integrate beautifully with Tailwind CSS 
- **React Toastify v10.0.5**: Toast integration in react

## Extra tools suggestions
- **NVM:** Instead of installing node directly on your computer, it is a better idea to install the node version manager (nvm) to dynamically switch between different versions of node.
- **WebStorm IDE:** I prefer Webstorm (from JetBrains) over vscode because the indexer is superior and recognizes autoimports and references better. Also, the refactoring tools are faster and more efficient than those provided by vscode.
